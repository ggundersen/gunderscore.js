Gunderscore
===========

Gunderscore.js is a JavaScript utility library for functional programming. I wrote this library while reading Michael Fogus' "Functional JavaScript."

The library is obviously inspired by Underscore.js and many functions were optimized after reading Ashkenas' source code. That said, I wrote the first draft of each function myself and intentionally kept the library simple for educational purposes. Furthermore, Underscore.js does a lot of interesting tricks for performance and usability. In these situations, I have erred on the side of readability, if only for myself.
